This is a little thing I made in 2010 which I thought at the time was lost forever.

It's a 6502 assembler written in Python that's oriented towards making nsf music.

Run nsf_blah.py in Python 2.x to get the only thing I ever made with it. The resulting file (blah.nsf) is a little larger than 2KB.
